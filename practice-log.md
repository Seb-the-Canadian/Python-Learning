- Practiced **loops** after running through some **variables** again.

- Still found that I was needing to refer to yesterday's practice file just to make sure that I was typing the commands correctly.

- Learned that *indents* __do__ matter when I printed a **loop** with `Done.` afterwards and it printed 
`Done.` after every item rather than after printing them all once each.

- Started to copy out the lessons from Tinkerstellar (even though I can just write directly in the program itself) to have some structured practice.
- Learned a little quirk where `;` is an acceptable way to have multiple expressions on one line, but it's not best practice - there's a setting in Zed that appears to call this out giving a link to an explanation and also linting it to best practice on save.


2025-11-15:
- Practiced simply storing **variables** and **printing in** the console.

- Ran into my first *error* when I realized that Zed didn't save the file automatically and therefore wasn't printing the contents, or even reading the contents properly.

- setup a `git repository` to track and backup my learning and backed it up via GitHUb.

- added a new variable, *commented out* my previous tests, wrote a new **f-string**.

- decided I had time to start practicing with **Lists** and **Loops** as well.

- practiced with making **lists** of both *integers* and *srings* - then, I called these using an **f-string** and **index access**
  - important to remember is that **lists** in Python start at `0` and that you can *short-cut* to the end of a list using `-1` (for example - this would call the last item in the list).
