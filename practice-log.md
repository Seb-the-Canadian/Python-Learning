- Practiced simply storing **variables** and **printing in** the console.

- Ran into my first *error* when I realized that Zed didn't save the file automatically and therefore wasn't printing the contents, or even reading the contents properly.

- setup a `git repository` to track and backup my learning and backed it up via GitHUb.

- added a new variable, *commented out* my previous tests, wrote a new **f-string**.

- decided I had time to start practicing with **Lists** and **Loops** as well.
