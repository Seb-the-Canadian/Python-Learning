# Conditional Statements and Operators

# Use Booleans to compare variables, data stuctures, and values.
# The first coniditional operiator is `==` to check for equality.

# Compare if 2 is equal to 3
# print(2 == 3)
# Compare if 2 does not equal 3
# print(2 != 3)
# Is 5 less than 7?
# print(5 < 7)
# Is 5 less than or equal to 7?
# print(5 <= 7)
# Is 5 greater than 7?
# print(5 > 7)
# Is 5 greater than or equal to 7?
# print(5 >= 7)
# You can compare strings - alphabetically!
# print("James" > "Brian")

# Check for a conditional using if

# Check pasta quantities
# required_quantity = 500
# pasta_quantity = 200
# Compare pasta quantities
# if pasta_quantity >= required_quantity:
#   print("You have enough pasta!")
# elif pasta_quantity >= 300:
#   print("Nearly enough pasta. Try a smaller portion.")
# Otherwise...
# else:
#   print("Not enough pasta.")

# pantry_stock = {"tomatoes": 700}
# ingredients_needed = {"tomatoes": 900}
# basil_grams = 50
# required_basil = 55
# Check if you have enough tomatoes for the full party
# if pantry_stock["tomatoes"] >= ingredients_needed["tomatoes"]:
# print("Enough tomatoes for the party!")
# Check if you have enough for a smaller gathering
# elif pantry_stock["tomatoes"] >= 800:
# print("Only enough tomatoes for a smaller gathering.")
# Handle the case where you need to buy more
# else:
# print("Need to buy tomatoes before the party.")

# Check if you have exactly the right amount of basil
# if basil_grams == required_basil:
# print("Perfect! You have exactly the right amount of basil.")
# else:
# print("You need to adjust your basil quantity.")
