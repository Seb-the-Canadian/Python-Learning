# Daily Python Practice

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Python through daily coding practice. The goal is simple: write Python code every day to improve my skills, track progress, and learn new concepts—one step at a time.

## About

- **Purpose:** Practice Python daily, experiment with new ideas, and build consistency.
- **Audience:** Anyone curious about Python, starting their own learning journey, or looking for inspiration.
- **Disclaimer:** I’m learning! Not everything will be perfect, but that’s part of the process.

## How This Works

- I add new Python scripts, notebooks, or snippets each day (or as often as possible).
- I'll pull these from DataCamp, Tinkerstellar, or other sources.
- Topics will range from basics (loops, functions) to more advanced experiments as I progress.
- You can follow along, fork this repo, or even suggest challenges!

## Project Structure

- Each file will be named by date or topic.
- Code may be messy at times—learning comes first, refactoring later!

## Lessons Learned

I’ll update this section regularly to reflect what I’m learning, struggles I overcome, and concepts I find interesting.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x  
(No external dependencies yet—just pure Python to start!)

##  Work in Progress

This is a living repository and will grow as I do. Feel free to check back for new updates!

##  Contributing

Feedback, suggestions, and new challenge ideas are very welcome—open an Issue or Pull Request!
